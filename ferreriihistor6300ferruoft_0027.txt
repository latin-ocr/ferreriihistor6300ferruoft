these preliminary explanations‚ which would have come better from the
Editor. No notes of his for this purpose have been discovered ; and it is
much to be feared‚ that his plan and views may sometimes have been mis-

accurate text, the Editor has allowed a few literal errors to pass, which
might, perhaps with advantage have been corrected. Most of these, it is

hoped‚ are noticed in the list of errata.
