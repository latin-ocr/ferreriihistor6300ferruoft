PREFACE.

So few Records of the Monastic Institutions of Scotland have come down
to us, that we receive with some interest even such a meagre and imper-
fect outline as Ferrerius has left us of the history of the Abbey of Kinloss.

J oannes Ferrerius, was, ’ as he tells us himself, a native of the little town

of Riva, in the territory of Chieri, in Piedmont. Educated at Turin and

, Paris in the literature and philosophy of the day, he appears, while at

the latter University, to have attracted the notice of Robert Reid, who
had shortly before been appointed successor of Thomas Chrystall in the
Abbacy of Kinloss. The new Abbot elect, with other leading churchmen
of Scotland at that time, had projected the reformation of the monastic
houseS, and the introduction of a more scholastic education than was then
attainable in this country. Ferrerius was recommended to his notice, as
a person qualified to assist in these objects, by Robert Richardson, himself
employed on a similar mission by the Abbot of Cambuskenneth ; and he
accompanied his patron to Scotland in 1528. After spending some time
at Court, he was established by the Abbot, at his monastery of Kinloss‚ as
a teacher of the monkS, and continued there, as he says, devoted to that
duty, and to private study, from 1531 till 1537, when we find him rc-

solving on a visit to his native country, which he carried into effect.
