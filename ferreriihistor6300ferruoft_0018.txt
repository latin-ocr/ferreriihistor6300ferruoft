viii PREFACE.

days for commemorating the Abbey’s benefactore. Some indicatione re-
main, however, of his endeavours to obtain more accurate information from
other sources‚(¹) and he occasionally quotes an ancient charter with an
exactness which shows that he had it before him while he wrote.(2)

The MS. which has been mostly followed, is that preserved in the
Advocates Library at Edinburgh.(³) It is evidently contemporary, and
probably written either in the author’s own hand, or by one of his pupils
at Kinloss. It has quite the appearance of a note-book, in which heads
and names of Abbots were entered, to be filled up as information should
offer. Numerous blanks remain, and these pages have, in some instances,
been used for writing exercises in Latin, probably by the pupils of Ferrerius.

Another, and probably a later manuscript of this work, said to be in
the handwritin g of the author‚(·¹) is preserved among the Queen of Sweden’s
MSS. in the Vatican.(⁵) From it, that part of the work has been printed
which is'published by Martene,(⁶) who has omitted the full life of Abbot
Thomas Chrystall.

Bishop Nicholson mentions that Dr. John J arneson had transcribed the
V atican MS„ “ and kindly communicated it to several of his learned
countrymen.’'(⁷) One of these undoubtedly was the industrious Wodrow,
and the transcript made by his own hand, is now in the Library of the

University of Glasgow. It has been collated for the present edition.

A few dates collected from authentic sources, may serve to correct

some of the inaccuracies of Ferrerius.
