PREFAOE. xiii

Some light has already been thrown upon the early endowments of the
Abbey of Kinloss by a few charters printed with the Chartulary of Moray.
A charter of Strathyla, by William the Lion, is also annexed to the present
volume. It has been printed from an old copy preserved in the Record
of Deeds(¹) in the General Register House, collated with a copy in Shaw’s·
History of Moray, which seems to have been printed from the original
Charter. ’

The Rental of the Abbey, which is given in the Appendix‚ is taken
from the Register of the Assumption of Benefices—a valuation made in
1562 and the following years, for regulating the third of the greater bene-
fices to be paid to the reformed Clergy and to the Crown. This particular
account would seem from a date which immediately follows it, to have
been rendered in 1574, but may have been earlier. It would appear not
to have been in all respects satisfactory. After a short valuation of the
Priory of Beaulieu, then held in commendam with Kinloss‚ the Register
has the following note 2-—“ Remember my Lord Comptrollare to speir the
rentall of thir tua, Kynlos and Bewlie, bettir, for thay ar suspitious anent
the fischingis.'' ¹

Hector Boece, who, Ferrerius tells us,(2) attended Abbot Thomas Chry-
stall during his last illness‚ describes Kinloss in his time in terms which
savour of his usual exaggeration‚-“ Nunc ibi coenobz’um est cum azqqustissimo
templo divoe virm-'ni sacro, cedibusque maqm’ficoe structura? piorum coetu Cis-
terciensis instituti insiqne, nulli in Albione reliyionis observatione secundam?⁷
Unfortunately we have no more particular account of the Abbey buildings
than what is afforded by Ferrerius. On the margin of one of the pag-es
of the Edinburgh M.S. is this note:

αἴθε stepen uf Japnlnss fell the fpft haye . . . . 1574.
