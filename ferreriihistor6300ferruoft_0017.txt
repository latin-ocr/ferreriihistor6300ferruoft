PREFACE. vii

In the diligent discharge of his duty as a toacher, with the occasional
distraction of composing some little treatise to raise his reputation in the
world or gain favour with a patron, our author’s life at Kinloss must have
passed away peacefully and pleasantly‚ notwithstanding the little dispute
which he dignifies somewhat too much in recording it.( 1) His posthumous
fortune has not been so enviable, since he has drawn down upon him the
indignation of Lord Hailes by two unlucky blunders which chanced to
cross his Lordship in his most earnest investigations. The first was the
repetition(2) of the foolish legend of St. David sending his messengers
to collect the laws of foreign stateS‚ and from these compiling the Reqiam ,
Mayiestatem. The other, if possible a more heinous offence in Lord
Hailes's estimation, consisted in rashly asserting that Adam Gordon
was created Earl of Sutherland, instead of beoominy Earl in right of his
wife, Elizabeth‚ the Gountess. For both of these transgressions he is
subjected to severe chastisement ;(3) and the latter brings under Lord
Hailes's censure the present work :--“ Had they looked,’' says his Lord-
ship‚ “ into his account of the Abbots of Kinloss, they would have per-
ceived how mean his abilities were, and how contemptible his station.’'(⁴)

It is indeed difficult to imagine any thing more imperfect and inaccu-
rate than the early part of the following work3 but if the fable of the
quiam, and the mistake about the Earldom of Sutherland, had not roused
Lord Hailes to more than usual indignation, he would not have censured
so severely a work which the author had not finished, and of the unavoid-
able imperfections of which he speaks in a tone to deprecate criticism.(⁵)
Our author's materials were evidently very defective, and seem to have

consisted of little more than the martyroloyz‘um, or obituary‚ recording the .
