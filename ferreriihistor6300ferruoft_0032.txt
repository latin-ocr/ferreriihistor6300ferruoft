NOTE.

Tun King's route can be traced pretty accurately. On Friday next after the translation of
St. Thomas the Martyr, (7 J uly,) 1336, Edwnrd set out from Perth with 400 men at arms,
and attended by an equal number of light horse and archers ς -and advanced eight miles.

On Saturday he came to the Castle of Blair Athol.

On Sunday, by a long march through the mountains, he reached a place in Badenoch, called
chhawyn, perhaps at the foot of Glen Fishie, which glen, in Blaeu, is called Avon Fishie.

On Monday, the King rode to Kincardin in Strathspey‚ and there leaving his baggage‚ he
crossed the moors to Lochindorb, raised the siege of the countess’s island castle, and then
returned to his retinue at Kincardin, having ridden 40 miles, lost many horscs, and suffered
severely from want of provisions. In this day's journey he must have crossed and recrossed
the Spey, where there was no bridge, and probably no other boats than the corbes vimineae
corio circumtectae, described by Straloch three hundred years afterwards.

Tuesday he went to a place called Aberkarf, 8 miles from Kincardin, from whence a party
was sent to collect cattle in the hills of Mar. The Countess of Atholl here joined the King.

On Wednesday he marched to the Abbey of Kinloss, buming Fortes, a good town, and the
country round. In the Abbey he found wine, ale, salt fish, corn, and other necessaries for his
army, and for the supply of the famished gar-rison of Lochindorb.

Thursday he proceeded to Elgin, sparing the town from respect for the blessed Trinity‚ but
burning the fertile country round.

On F'riday the King crossed the Spey, probably by the antient bridge a few miles above
Foehabers, and reached cullen.

On Saturday he came to the priory of Fivie in Buchan.

On Sunday, leaving the Castle of Kildrummy on the right, he arrived at night at the city of
Aberdeen.

Monday and Tuesday the King devoted to superintending the complete burning of the towns
of Old and New Aberdeen, with the country around.

On Wednesday, passing by Dunnottar Castle, he came to a place called Mortoun in the
Meams.

Thursday, sixteen miles.

Friday to Forfar‚ which must have been considered within the English pale, and as termi-
nating the interest of Edward's adventurous journey.

The account is so minutely circumstancial, and is, moreover, so corroborated by other
authorities, that we cannot doubt its correctness ; and, whether we consider the troops em-
ployed, the roads and the nature of the country, or the rapidity of the march, it is altogether
one of the most marvellous expeditioris on record.
