PREFACE. ix

The Abbey of Kinloss, situate‚ as the name implies, at the head of the
lake or basin formed at the mouth of the River Findorn, was founded by

King David I. in 1150,(¹) for Cistercian monks brought from the Abbey
of Melros.

The first Abbot was Ascelinus, who died in 1174.(2)

Reinerius‚ a monk of the mother house of Melros, succeeded. He was
subsequently chosen Abbot of Melros in 1188.(3)

On the promotion of Reinerius‚ Radulphus the prior was made Abbot
of Kinloss. He is styled in the Chronicle of Melros, ‘ third Abbot of
Kynlos,’ which excludes the supposed Abbot Andrew of F errerius. Like

· his predecessor, he was afterwards elected Abbot of Melros, and left Kin-

loss in 1194.(4)

Abbot Ralph was probably succeeded by another of the same name;
since we find ‘ Radulphus de Kinlos’ among the excommunicated Cister-
cian Abbots in 1218.(⁵)

Herbertus was Abbot of Kinloss in 1 22956) who resigned the office—vir
yrandoevus—in 125l.(7)

Richard was the next Abbot. He died in England on his return from
attending the chapter of his order at Citeaux, in 1274.(8)

His successor was Andrew‚ prior of the Monastery of Newbotle.(9)

Father Hay(10) asserts that Richard‚ Abbot of Kinloss, did homage to
Edward in 1296. He does not quote his authority.

In 1316, we find Thomas, Abbot of Kinloss.(U)
